## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Leo Ohyama. I'm a data scientist at the University of Florida applying a variety of statistical and machine learning approaches to assessing the impacts of various reading interventions on grade-school literacy. Additionally, I develop and maintain several repositories to disemminate and communicate both findings and other metrics to various stakeholders. My background is in quantitative ecology and biodiversity where I went from running large scale field experiments to modelling global biodiversity patterns and processes.  

My usual every day tools include:
R (variety of libraries), Shiny, Quarto, some python, Github Actions, splash of html, JS, etc.
